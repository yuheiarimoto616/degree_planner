## Degree Planner Project

Project Description: <br>
My project is to design a **degree planner application**. Its main purpose is 
to *help students plan their degree at UBC*. In the application, users can 
add courses they have completed, are taking, or planning to take to the application. They 
can view the courses they added. In addition to that, they can see average grade of all the courses they've 
completed and letter grade for each course. <br>
The target users are **university students**. And the reason why this project is of interest
to me is I myself want to plan my degree, and I believe many students can benefit
from the application by making the degree planning easier. 

## User Stories: 
  - As a user, I want to be able to add a course to my degree planner
  - As a user, I want to be able to delete a course from my planner
  - As a user, I want to be able to view the list of courses I've added 
to my planner with grades, its status, and number of credits.
  - As a user, I want to be able to mark a course as completed, currently
  taking, or planning
  - As a user, I want to be able to add grade to a course when completed
  - As a user, I want to be able to see the average grade of all the courses I've completed<br> <br>
  - As a user, when I select to save, I want to be able to save my degree planner to file.
  - As a user, when I select to load, I want to be able to load 
my saved degree planner from file.
