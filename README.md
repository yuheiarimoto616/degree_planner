## Degree Planner Project

Project Description: <br>
My project is to design a **degree planner application**. Its main purpose is 
to *help students plan their degree at UBC*. In the application, users can 
add courses they have completed, are taking, or planning to take to the application. They 
can view the courses they added. In addition to that, they can see average grade of all the courses they've 
completed and letter grade for each course. <br>
The target users are **university students**. And the reason why this project is of interest
to me is I myself want to plan my degree, and I believe many students can benefit
from the application by making the degree planning easier.
