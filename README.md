## Degree Planner Project

Project Description: <br>
My project is to design a **degree planner application**. Its main purpose is 
to *help students plan their degree at UBC*. In the application, users can 
add courses they are taking or planning to take to the application, which
then tells the users how many more credits and what courses they need to take to 
graduate and requirements (such as science breadth, communication requirements, etc)
they still haven't fulfilled based on degree or specialization they input in 
the application. Also, the application displays a course schedule based on
the courses they are taking and average grades of all the courses they have 
completed. If the time permits, I'm also planning to implement a function
that alert users that their schedule might be tight if they have back-to-back
classes and the locations are far away from each other. <br>
The target users are **BC students**. And the reason why this project is of interest
to me is I myself want to plan my degree, and I believe many students can benefit
from the application by making the degree planning easier.
